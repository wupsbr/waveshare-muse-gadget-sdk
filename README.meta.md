Muse gadgets are open source devices you build yourself. Program an
off-the-shelf ESP32 board or set up a Raspberry Pi with our device SDKs, then
connect Muse to your displays, buttons, sensors, actuators, and whatever else
you've got lying on your workbench.

We open sourced the SDKs and firmware here. It's built by hackers, for hackers,
just for fun. Side effects of tinkering may include bricked boards, voided
warranties, brownouts, or bankruptcies. Proceed at your own risk!

| | |
|---|---|
| [**ESP32 Device SDK**](esp32) | Connect your ESP32 board to Muse through our open source SDK. Throw in a screen to show images, add audio in and out, or wire up other sensors. |
| [**Linux Device SDK**](linux) | Turn that spare Raspberry Pi or Linux box into a Muse gadget. Hack in your own commands to let Muse handle sysadmin chores or your Home Assistant setup. |

Before you flash or pair a gadget, get an
[SDK token](https://gadgets.muse.ai/settings/sdk-tokens) and review the
[Gadget SDK Terms](https://gadgets.muse.ai/sdk-terms). Every gadget needs a
token to pair.

ESP32 and Linux gadgets pair with the Muse app on iOS and Android, via
Settings > Devices. Turn on Developer mode there first, then look for devices
prefixed with "MuseGadget".
Each directory has a `README.md` to get started and an `AGENTS.md` for coding
agents like [Muse Code](https://developer.meta.com/ai/lp/muse-code/).
